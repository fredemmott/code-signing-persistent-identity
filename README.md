# What is this repository?

As I have an individual code signing key instead of an organizational one, the identity of my key varies depending on my personal life events.

This repository contains signed metadata to support
[MSIX persistent identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/package/persistent-identity), allowing upgrading from old versions
to new versions with a different certificate identity.

Please do not file any pull requests or issues - they can not be acted on.
